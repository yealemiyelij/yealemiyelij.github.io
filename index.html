            <img src="assets/images/wondu.jpg" class="auth-image">
            <p>Every professional has a background in certain field of Studies.
                Some change their career through a process of time following economic intake,
                interest and professional dynamism, while others are so static and keep their as-is profession.
                Underlining the limitless human interest, I certainly align myself with the first group.</p>
        
            <p> My great passion is throwing myself to a challenging professional environment
                {emp, in a professional perspective} to get a diverse experience and knowledge.
                It really helps me to be strong in my life and to coup up with situations and environments.
                I know that no single approach is the right path for every life ups and down,
                and I believe that I have to be trained in certain fields, 
                and so I have been studied different field of studies including Law, Conflict Resolution,
                 Financial Service and, know in computer programing aspect.</p>

            <p> My educational background includes a LLB in Law, MA in International Security Sector Management
                 from Cranfield University. I have also different Certifications including
                Certified in Defense and Legal Affairs Attache,AML/ CFT.
                I have also an extensive experience in the filed of law “especially in public prosecution,
